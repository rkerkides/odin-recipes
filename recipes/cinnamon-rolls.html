    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Prep today, bake tomorrow morning.</p>
    <p>Making homemade cinnamon rolls is a time-consuming process. Between making the dough, letting the dough rise (twice, for that matter), assembling them, and baking, there’s just no way to feasibly make them for breakfast without waking up at the crack of dawn. But overnight cinnamon rolls are a different story: By doing the bulk of the work the night before you can wake up, immediately pop them in the oven, and enjoy warm, ooey-gooey cinnamon rolls in no time. The problem is that not all cinnamon roll recipes are written that way, so you might think that your go-to recipe can’t be made in advance. Luckily, any cinnamon roll recipe can be turned into an overnight version and without much effort—you just need to know how. Here’s everything you need to know about turning any cinnamon roll recipe into overnight cinnamon rolls.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 package instant yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade cinnamon rolls:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, heat the water, milk, and butter until the butter is melted. Remove from heat and let cool to lukewarm.</li>
        <li>Add the lukewarm liquid mixture and egg to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a large rectangle. Spread the softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the butter.</li>
        <li>Roll up the dough tightly and cut into 12 even pieces.</li>
        <li>Place the rolls in a greased baking dish and let them rise for 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes, until they are golden brown.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract to make the glaze.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the glaze over the warm cinnamon rolls and serve.</li>
      </ol>
