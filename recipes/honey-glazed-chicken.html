    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This honey chicken recipe was given to me by a friend. I've used this recipe for years, and my family requests it often. It's a light meal that everyone will enjoy. Serve with steamed rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade honey glazed chicken:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the honey, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the skillet and cook until browned on all sides, about 6-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and pour the honey mixture over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Stir to coat the chicken evenly with the honey glaze.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken for an additional 2-3 minutes, until the glaze thickens and the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and let the chicken rest for a few minutes to allow the glaze to set.</li>
        <li>Serve the honey glazed chicken over rice or with your choice of side dishes.</li>
      </ol>
